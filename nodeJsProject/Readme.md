## How to use the server

The server features 3 main pages :
- Login (https://localhost8080/login)

in the login page, you can enter your information to acess to the main page. You can also use the button at the bottom to go to the signup page.

- Signup (https://localhost8080/signup)

in the signup page, you can create a new user, and then use the name and the password to acess to the metric page and start using the interface.

- Index (https://localhost8080/index)

Finally, in the Index page, you will have access to tools such as a metric form to add or modify informations, to watch the graph that sums up all the metrics, and finally to a list to see and delete the metrics already in the database.
